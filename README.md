# AQI-Report-Analysis

An AQI (Air Quality Index) Analysis project in Power BI is designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize air quality data to provide insights into pollution levels, trends, and potential health impacts. This project uses AQI data from various sources and displays it in interactive dashboards, helping users understand air quality patterns over time and across regions.

Key components of an AQI Analysis project include:

AQI Overview and Trends: Visualizations like line charts and heat maps to display AQI trends over time, highlighting days with poor air quality and seasonal variations in pollution levels.

Regional Analysis: Maps and bar charts showing AQI by region, city, or neighborhood, allowing users to identify highly polluted areas and understand regional disparities in air quality.

Pollutant Breakdown: Breakdown of key pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2) to assess which pollutants are contributing most to poor air quality, helping to focus on specific sources of pollution.

Health Impact Indicators: Indicators that highlight the health risk associated with different AQI levels, categorizing air quality as “Good,” “Moderate,” “Unhealthy,” etc., and linking data to potential health advisories.

Time-of-Day and Seasonal Patterns: Analysis of daily and seasonal patterns in AQI data, helping users understand when pollution levels peak and the best times for outdoor activities.

Predictive Analytics and Alerts: Use of predictive models to forecast future AQI levels based on historical data and weather conditions, supporting proactive air quality management and alerting users to potential risks.

Comparative Analysis: Comparison of AQI across multiple locations or time periods to see how air quality is changing over time or relative to other cities.

Power BI’s interactive features make it easy for users to drill down into specific data points, uncover insights, and drive initiatives to improve air quality and protect public health.
